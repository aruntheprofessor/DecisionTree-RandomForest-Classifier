# DecisionTree-RandomForest-Classifier
In this task, I implemented and compared tree-based machine learning models using the Heart Disease dataset. I performed the following steps:

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier, visualized the tree structure, and analyzed overfitting by controlling tree depth.

Trained a Random Forest Classifier and compared its performance against the decision tree.

Evaluated both models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualized feature importance to understand which features contributed most to the prediction.

Performed cross-validation to validate the model stability and reliability.

This helped me understand decision trees, ensemble methods, and feature interpretation more deeply.
